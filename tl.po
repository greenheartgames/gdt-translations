"Larger games deserve to be seen by more people and this is where a publisher can come in handy.{n}A publisher will market and publish your game around the world. They will also help fund development. In return they keep most of the profits but since the game will sell a lot more it is usually still worth it.{n}I can put you in touch with some publishers so you can look at some of the available contracts.

msgstr ""

msgid "After careful examination we come to the conclusion that the internet is a huge opportunity in the gaming industry. We already see some small signs how successful multiplayer games can be but multiplayer is usually an additional feature to a game and not the main focus.{n}We think we could develop technologies to create a massively multiplayer online game (short MMO), a game where tens of thousands of players can play together. To create such an MMO more research is necessary.{n}The second discovery is that we could start developing an online distribution platform. Instead of players buying games in local stores they could download games directly from our servers. This would cut out the middle man and we could gain a large share of the market and additional income to fund our developments."
msgstr ""

msgid "Codename: Grid"
msgstr ""

msgid "A bold plan to develop an internet-based distribution platform for games. Rather than buying games through retailers players worldwide can simply download them. The platform features digital rights management to combat piracy and also enables a new market for smaller developers to show off their products."

msgstr ""

msgid "Since we already have our own console we have integrated this service into our console. This should boost our market share considerably."

msgid "This system should boost the market share of the PC considerably and if we ever have our own console it will also be of great benefit."

msgid "License Game Engines"
msgstr ""

msgid "We have a lot of experience in creating custom game engines. Why not sub-license our engines to other developers? Not only will this cement our market position as a technology leader but it will also help offset the growing costs of developing engines."
msgstr ""

msgid "Software doesn't run without hardware. We are experts in creating software but why not also investigate whether we can create our own hardware?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Our research is complete. There is definitely a big opportunity ahead of us. If we create our own hardware lab and have the appropriate technology specialists to run it then we could even create our very own gaming console!{n}It would not be cheap and it will probably take us a few years but maybe we could even trump the likes of an mBox or the Playsystem!"

msgid "Massively Multiplayer Online games! We know how much fun it is to play multiplayer games but imagine that instead of playing with a handful of players you could play with thousands! This project will unlock a brand new genre to allow you to create MMO games."
msgstr ""

msgid "Boss, our research into massively multiplayer online (MMO) games is complete. The possibilities of MMOs are big but they are also risky. In our research we realized that before we can begin to develop an MMO we will need to create a special game engine for it.{n}You will need to complete the research for the MMO support feature with one of your staff. Once it is integrated into a game engine you can start building an MMO but be careful. It seems that MMOs only work with the best theme/genre combinations and you will also need to have specialists on your team to make an MMO successful."

msgstr ""

msgid "Boss, our research into AAA games is complete and we can now begin to create AAA games. A triple A game requires well-trained staff and it is best to have specialists in the different areas to make sure the team does their best work.{n}When creating a AAA game we can also use the R&D lab to develop a special marketing campaign which greatly enhances the hype around the game."

msgid "Stage 1"
msgstr ""

msgid "The game engine provides the basic building block of a game, the underlying technology. A good engine also enables things like multiplayer support, video playback and realistic physics."
msgstr ""

msgid "Gameplay defines how a player interacts with the game and how the game mechanics, the rules that make a game tick, work."
msgstr ""

msgid "Storytelling and giving players goals to complete have been the basics of games for a long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 2"
msgstr ""

msgid "Dialogues are part of storytelling as well but also provide interaction between NPC's (non-player characters) and the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "Level design defines the structure a player takes through a game. This includes simple things like where objects are located but also the story arcs in a game."
msgstr ""

msgid "A.I. is how computer controlled entities (enemies, companions or the world itself) reacts to the player."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stage 3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some games invent an entire virtual world. World design delivers a back story to a game and makes the game world more sophisticated and believable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Graphics"
msgstr ""

msgid "The most obvious part of a game are its graphics but that doesn't mean it is always the most important part."
msgstr ""

msgid "While sound is not as often noticed as the graphics of a game, sound design plays a vital part to making a game great."
